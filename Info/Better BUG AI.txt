Components:
Better BTS AI 1.02a r597
* AI Logging
BULL 1.3 r219
* Fractional Trade Routes
* New Sentry Actions
* City Governours Build Workers
BUG 4.5 r2245

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my own changes:
 * CityAI:
    * The AI no longer considers unhealthy buildings that would make the city shrink, and also
     factors in future unheathiness from power when evaluating buildings that would recieve a bonus
     from power
    * Happy/Health valuation for buildings and improvements are sightly changed
    * The AI should build a bit more workers
    * Worker AI: hopefully there is now less improvement oscillation between forest preserve and lumbermills,
     and less hamlets/villages/towns get turned to workshops
    * Considering currently constructed building and checking Health level against happy level
     for the BULL feature 'Health Effects from Removing Features'
	* Early defender logic: Warriors blocking a unitai no longer causes troubles
 * PlayerAI:
    * Using a sightly different valuation of siege units for UNITAI_ATTACK_CITY
    * Using a sightly different values for targetCityValue
	* Improved Civic AI
 * UnitAI:
    * AI should try to break blockades more often
    * Improved city placement, including capital
 * Gamespeed scaling:
    * Chance of nuclear plants to blow up and global warming chance scale to gamespeed
 * other:
    * Minimum total production modifiers is still 0% here (UP/BetterAI changed it to -50%)
    * Features with AppearanceProbability of 10000 will be replaced after destruction of city,
     even if not riverside (original UP: only riverside)
	* AI Players can capture workers from other AI players even if they are not inside a city
    * xml changes:
          o CIV4UnitInfos.xml: changed iPower for Catapult(5->6), Cannon(12->14), Artillery(18->19) and
           MobileArtillery(26->28) because they seem to better account for the actual military strength of
           these units. (Does not affect AI unit building behaviour)
!         o CIV4UnitInfos.xml: SAM Infantry is now available as an upgrade to the Grenadier (previously Infantry)
            - to avoid massive upgrading of riflemen to SAM when the AI hits Rocketery before Assembly line
