------------------
My own changes:

* added my own code that should hinder the AI from considering unhealthy buildings that would make the
 city shrink, also factors in future unheathiness from power when evaluating buildings that would
 recieve a bonus from power

* changed CIV4UnitInfos.xml: SAM Infantry is available as an upgrade to the Grenadier (previously
 Infantry) - to avoid massive upgrading of riflemen to SAM when the AI hits Rocketery before
 Assembly line. Also changed iPower for Catapult(5->6), Cannon(12->14), Artillery(18->19),
 MobileArtillery(26->28) to make the AI value them more - If you don't want any of that, just use the
 standard file.

* Global Warming: Nuke Weight is set to 0 in GlobalDefines, so no GW from nukes, which should mean
 no GW happening at all for 99% of games.
