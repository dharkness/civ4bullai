Components:
Better BTS AI 1.01b r576
* AI Logging
BULL 1.2+ r200
* Fractional Trade Routes
* New Sentry Actions
* City Governours Build Workers
BUG 4.4 r2236

 Unofficial Patch r30: Total production modifiers are not allowed to be negative, 
  this UP release would change this to allow down to -50. This will never be part of Better BUG AI.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my own changes:

    * The AI no longer considers unhealthy buildings that would make the city shrink, and also
     factors in future unheathiness from power when evaluating buildings that would recieve a bonus
     from power.
    * Worker AI: hopefully there is now less improvement oscillation between forest preserve and lumbermills,
     and less hamlets/villages/towns get turned to workshops.
    * Considering currently constructed building and checking Health level against happy level
	 for Health Effects from Removing Features.
    * xml changes:
          o CIV4UnitInfos.xml: changed iPower for Catapult(5->6), Cannon(12->14), Artillery(18->19) and
           MobileArtillery(26->28) because they seem to better account for the actual military strength of
		    these units. (Does not affect AI unit building behaviour).
          o CIV4UnitInfos.xml: SAM Infantry is now available as an upgrade to the Grenadier (previously Infantry)
            - to avoid massive upgrading of riflemen to SAM when the AI hits Rocketery before Assembly line.
